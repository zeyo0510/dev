* ClosedXML:
  ClosedXML makes it easier for developers to create Excel 2007/2010/2013 files.
  It provides a nice object oriented way to manipulate the files (similar to VBA) without 
  dealing with the hassles of XML Documents. It can be used by any .NET language like 
  C# and Visual Basic (VB).
