What is this ?
===============
Emulators Organizer is an advanced program designed in order to manage\play your roms, Games, E-Books,Compressed files, Music and any type of file.
Emulators Organizer simply described as launcher, you can use it for different purposes, although the main purpose is to manage roms and emulators.
You can manage your roms (delete, add .....) , attach an image and a text file to each rom so that the rom may includes single or multi screenshot and info, determine command lines for each emulator so that when you run a game using it the program sends your command lines to the emulator with the rom path automaticaly, and no need to add any command line if you want to run the game basicly.

It's work like Game and application launcher, Just pick up something and double click on it, very easy to setup and use, It works like rom library, create a list of consoles, each console (e.g. : Nes) may include several emulators and roms which can be listed in categories.

Also you can use playlists which includes roms from different consoles. You can arrange the roms in the order you want, drag and drop to sort 'em, copy and paste from / into playlist and more.

If your emulator doesn't support archive reading (like zip files), Emulators Organizer can extract the archive file and send the rom from inside it instead the archive file itself.

Known Issues:
=============
* Don't make a lot of media players (sound/video tabs) more than 6 player at once ! this will
  cause a major performance lag (or even system crash). 3 players or less at once is the best 
  choice.
* Using HD pictures in styles (console style, playlist style ..etc) will make the profile file
  even larger and may decrease performance. Please make sure to use small resolution pictures 
  for styles, 1024 x 720 resolution or smaller image sizes are recommended.
* If you face a problem of Access Denied of any kind (when creating folder using EO, trying
  to run a rom compressed...etc), you'll need to enable "Run this program as and administrator".
  To do so, right click on EmulatorsOrganizer.exe file then choose properties.
  Go to Compatibility tab and enable "Run this program as and administrator". Click OK to save.
  EO should run fine after that.
* If you have a problem or issue in the program, please activate the logger:
  Run the EOWithLogger.bat file or send the command /logger to EO executable file, it
  should be something like this: EmulatorsOrganizer.exe /trace /logger
  The /trace command will open the trace window.
  After that, you should be able to find the log file in the Logs folder, the file
  should include "master" in the name along with date, send that file to ahdsoftwares@hotmail.com
  or post it in the forums "https://emulator-organizer-f.forumotion.com/" this will help
  us detect the problem to help you and fix the issue in the next release.

Want to contribute :
====================
You don't have to be a programmer to contribute to our project :)
All we need is:
* Styles to share with the community ! the amazing style editor tool in the program allows to
  export the style into files, share the styles you create at the forums 
  "https://emulator-organizer-f.forumotion.com/" 
* We need to make EO more global, ui translations are the most needed. By default, EO comes
  with English US language as interface language, if you are intersted making more languages
  supported please contact us at alaahadidfreeware@gmail.com
  Translation is not hard with the tools we use, it only may take a few hours of work.
* Did you know that EO profiles can be shared !? just make a profile with the consoles
  including styles and basic information such as file types, don't add roms or ics, save
  the profile file then share it at the forums.
