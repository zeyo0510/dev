Emulators Organizer command lines
----------------------------------
* First command line must be profile path, if no path included it's ok but if you add the profile
  path anywhere else in the commandlines the program will ignore it.
  Example (with profile): <profile path> /trace /logger...etc
  Example (no profile): /trace /logger...etc

* /logger: enable the text logger, a file will record all trace events of EO, the file will be saved
           in the Logs folder in the program directory. This will make EO slower 'cause it will record
           all program events.

* /trace: open the trace window when the program run.
