      <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all visitors and users of the boxy-svg.com web app
        (“App”), which is offered by Jarosław Foksa and/or any of his affiliates (“Boxy SVG”, “we”, “us”).</p>

        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using any part of the “App”, you
        acknowledge you have been informed of and consent to our practices with regard to your personal
        information and data.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>What information Boxy SVG collects and why</h3>

        <section>
          <h4>Information from App visitors</h4>

          <p>Like most web app operators, Boxy SVG collects basic non-personally-identifying information from
          App visitors of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser
          type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect
          this information to better understand how visitors use the App, to improve our App and experience for
          visitors, and to monitor security of the App.</p>

          <p>Boxy SVG also collects potentially personally-identifying information like IP addresses from
          visitors. Boxy SVG does not use such information to identify or track individual visitors, however.
          We collect this information to understand how visitors use the App, to improve performance and
          content, and to monitor security of the App.</p>

          <p>Boxy SVG may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our App. For instance, Boxy SVG
          may reveal how many views a particular file got using aggregated statistics that contain anonymous
          user information only.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Personally-identifying information</h4>

          <p>Users of the App may choose to interact with Boxy SVG in ways that provide us with their
          personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Boxy SVG gathers depends
          on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share.
          For example, we ask visitors who want to publish content on the App to provide a username and email
          address to identify them.</p>

          <p>We will also collect the information you provide us in connection with creating an account on the
          App. Basic profile information is shared publicly, as well as activity under your profile and the
          date your profile was created. If you report a security vulnerability to Boxy SVG and request public
          acknowledgement, then we may publicly disclose the personal information you provided to us in
          connection with the report, including your name to fulfill your request for acknowledgement. In each
          case, Boxy SVG collects such personally-identifiable information only insofar as is necessary or
          appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the user’s interaction with or request of Boxy SVG. We will not
          disclose personally-identifying information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

          <p>Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it
          may prevent you from engaging in certain App-related activities or being able to access and use
          certain features and services.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Information Boxy SVG does not collect</h4>

          <p>Boxy SVG does not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security
          numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Boxy SVG does not
          request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that users might
          store this kind of information in a Boxy SVG cloud storage. If you store any sensitive personal
          information on Boxy SVG’s servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our
          servers, which are located in the United States.</p>

          <p>If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an App account. Boxy SVG does
          not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our App or content specifically to children
          under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the
          child’s account.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Basis for processing your information</h4>

          <p><strong>Performance of a contract</strong>. The use of your information may be necessary to
          perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our App to purchase Boxy SVG
          subscriptions, report bugs, report feature requests, create a profile, post and comment through our
          App, or request information through our App, we will use your information to carry out our obligation
          to complete and administer that contract or request.</p>

          <p><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>. We use your information for our legitimate interests, such
          as to provide you with the best content through our App and communications with users and the public,
          to improve and promote our products and services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention
          and legal purposes.</p>

          <p><strong>Consent</strong>. We may rely on your consent to use your personal information for certain
          direct marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about Boxy SVG. You may withdraw
          your consent at any time through the unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email or by
          contacting us at the addresses given at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>How Boxy SVG uses and protects personally-identifying information</h3>

        <section> <h4>Sharing your information</h4>

          <p>Boxy SVG only discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
          to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
          information in order to process it on Boxy SVG's behalf or to provide services available on the App,
          and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.</p>

          <p>Boxy SVG will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
          information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as
          described above, Boxy SVG discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
          information only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
          reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Boxy SVG, third parties, or the public at
          large.</p>

          <p>Boxy SVG takes measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
          alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
          information.</p> </section>

        <section>
          <h3>International transfer of information</h3>

          <p>The App is hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed on
          our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that
          process information for us as described above may be located in the United States or in other
          countries outside of your home country; by using the App, you consent to the international transfer
          of your information by Boxy SVG.</p> </section>

        <section> <h4>Boxy SVG communications with you</h4>

          <p>If you are a registered user of the App and have supplied your email address, Boxy SVG may
          occasionally send you an email to tell you about security, system information, new features, solicit
          your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Boxy SVG and our products. We
          primarily use our App to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of
          email to a minimum. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails
          we send you so you can stop receiving such emails at any time.</p>

          <p>If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
          we reserve the right to publish your request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
          or to help us support other users. We will not publish your personally-identifiable information in
          connection with your request.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Cookies, tracking technologies and "Do not track"</h3>

        <section>
          <h4>Cookies</h4>

          <p>A cookie is a string of information that a web app stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
          visitor's browser provides to the web app each time the visitor returns. Boxy SVG uses cookies to
          help Boxy SVG identify and track visitors, their usage of the App, and their App access preferences.
          Boxy SVG visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may set their browsers to
          refuse cookies before using the App. Disabling browser cookies may cause certain features of Boxy
          SVG's App to not function properly.</p>

          <p>Certain pages on the App may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content,
          such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. These sites set their own cookies and we do not
          have access or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our
          Privacy Policy.</p> </section>

        <section> <h4>Tracking technologies</h4>

          <p>We use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to track you individually or
          collect your personally identifiable-information. We use these services to collect information about
          how the App performs and how users navigate through and use the App so we can monitor and improve our
          content and App performance.</p>

          <p>Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying information over
          time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages,
          timestamp, and similar data about your use of the App. We do not link this information to any of your
          personal information such as your user name.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>"Do not track"</h4>

          <p>"Do not track" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online
          services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third
          party tracking services. Boxy SVG does not track your online browsing activity on other online
          services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site
          beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not share this kind of data with
          third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection for any of our users, and we
          do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an
          individual browser's "Do not track" setting.</p>
        </section>

        <h3>Global privacy practices</h3>

        <p>Information we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this
        Privacy Policy but we understand that users from other countries may have different expectations and
        rights with regard to their privacy. For all App visitors and users, no matter their country of
        location, we will:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Provide clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent when we do collect your personal
          information.</li>

          <li>Only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary for the purpose it is collected for,
          unless you choose to provide us more.</li>

          <li>Offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting your information that we have
          collected, with the exception of information you voluntarily provide that is necessary to retain as
          is for the integrity of our project code as described further below.</li>

          <li>Provide App users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose
          for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are located in the European Union, you are entitled to the following rights with regard to
        your personal information and data:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Right of access to your personal data, to know what information about you we hold.</li>
          <li>Right to correct any incorrect or incomplete personal data about yourself that we hold.</li>
          <li>Right to restrict/suspend our processing of your personal data.</li>
          <li>Right to complain to a supervisory authority if you believe your privacy rights are being
          violated.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additional rights that may apply to you in certain instances:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Right of data portability (if our processing is based on consent and automated means).</li>
          <li>Right to withdraw consent at any time (if processing is based on consent).</li>
          <li>Right to object to processing (if processing is based on legitimate interests).</li>
          <li>Right to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
          <li>Right of erasure of your personal data from our system (“right to be forgotten”) if certain
          grounds are met.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To exercise your privacy rights, you can email us at the address given below in the "Contacting Boxy
        SVG About Your Privacy" section of this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Data retention and deletion</h3>

        <p>If you already have an account on boxy-svg.com, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic
        user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.</p>

        <p>Boxy SVG will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform
        our contractual obligations, provide you services through the App, to comply with legal obligations,
        resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.</p>

        <p>We will erase any information once it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it
        was collected and processed.</p>

        <p>Please note that due to public nature of some of our services, we may retain limited
        personally-identifiable information indefinitely. For example, if you provide your information in
        connection with a bug report or a comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted
        your account as we do not automatically delete community posts.</p>
      </section>
