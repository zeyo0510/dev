Title: System Information II (Update #1)
Description: This VB9 utility program is a major upgrade to my previous System Information submission. This version offers, in addition to information, the ability to control the information displayed. You can start/stop drivers and service, uninstall programs, control processes, set OEM computer information including logo/picture, share/unshare folders, delete startup programs, and modify user/company information.
The complete list of categories is Bios, Components, Computer, Cpu, DateAndTime, Desktop, Drivers, Drives, EnvironmentVariables, EventViewer, FileTypes, Fonts, InstalledPrograms, Introduction, Keyboard, MultimediaCodecs, Network, OEMInformation, OperatingSystem, PointingDevice, Ports, Processes, Services, Shares, Sound, SpecialFolders, StartupPrograms, UsbDevices, UserInformation, Video, VisualStyles, Win32Explorer Hardware, Win32Explorer Memory, Win32Explorer Network, Win32Explorer Storage, Win32Explorer System, and Win32Explorer Users.
By examining the source code, this application will familarize the reader with .NET WMI class methods, Panels used as UserControls, TreeView, ListView, and ListViewGroups.
This update fixes a problem when the application starts as a notification icon.
